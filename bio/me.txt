I am a crazy, real person interested in learning. dfsdfsdfsf
I can be a called a Rennaisance woman, because I am one indeed. 
I hope I get into med school and get to do all the millions of artistic things that I desire to do.
I want to live and eat so much of life, I hope that I can balance my life and get my body back into shape grrrrr, grrrrr.
